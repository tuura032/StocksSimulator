Stocks (or finance) is a web app that allows a user to create an account, and then proceed to purchase and sell stocks. A user may also 
choose to enter a valid credit card to "add" (but not really) more funds to purchase more stocks.

At part of this project, I created databases (SQLite), implemented most of the HTML webpages, wrote the python code for each HTML page
I wrote, and added a helper function to check for a valid credit card. The remainder was made available to me as part of the edX course
"CS50".
